    <summary>Sift - grep on steroids</summary>
    <description>### Features

#### It's fast. really fast.
Some grep alternatives try to be fast by not searching everywhere. sift was developed with performance in mind and just is fast.
Take a look at the benchmarks for details.

#### No installation
sift comes as a single executable with no dependencies and is available for all major platforms (Linux, Windows, OS X, BSD)
Need to use sift on a remote server? Just copy it over and it will work - no problems due to missing packages.

#### Flexiblity. all the features you expect from a modern grep alternative.

- RegEx - perl compatible regular expression syntax (no more escape hell)
- usable defaults - basic options known from grep but with usable defaults
- multiline support - find matches spanning over multiple lines
- replace - replace output to reformat it to your needs without relying on awk/sed
- gzip files - search through normal and gzip'ed files in one program call
- multiple patterns - search for multiple patterns in one run
- target selection - select or exclude search targets based on file name, directory name, path and type
- handling big data - sift handles big files without problems: files greater than 50GB, 5,000,000,000 lines, and 5,000,000,000 matches successfully tested
- customizable - optional global and local configuration file to specify your own preferences

#### Use Conditions
Doing code audits? Need to extract data from complex formats?
sift will make this much easier.
You may specify various conditions and only get matches.
- preceded by A
- followed by B within X lines
- if the file also contains a line with C
- if the file contains D in the first Y lines
- any combination of the available conditions
